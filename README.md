## <span style="color:#006aff">Hi there! Welcome to my github ðŸ™‹

<span style="color:#006aff">My name is Adam, I am 25 years old and I live in Poland. I recently graduated from university in the field of computer science. I have been programming for several years. At the beginning, I did it mainly for the classroom. As part of the progress. I saw that I could create more and more interesting things. It makes me want to implement my ideas all the time. I am mainly interested in writing applications in web technologies and creating games on the unity engine.


<span style="color:#006aff">I am currently working on a multiplayer game project using a fresh network solution from unity called Netcode for GameObjects.
